I am 28 years old, I live and work in Belarus, in Minsk. I work as a taxi driver. In June 2021, I decided to become a front-end developer and enter the information technology field. I believe that IT and the Internet are the future, so I want to develop in this area. I enjoy working in a team and learning something new every time. It’s interesting and fun, especially when you get feedback and results. At the moment I am taking the Stage0 JS / FE Pre-School course at RS school. In the future, I want to become a front-end developer and make the world a better place by creating quality websites. For a powerful and confident start, I chose EPAM because it is serious, well-known and ready to help newcomers like me enter the IT field and build a career, gain teamwork and programming skills. I believe that everything will work out for me.
